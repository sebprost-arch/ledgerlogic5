Let me save you some time: both are excellent cloud accounting platforms. The real question is <strong>which one fits your specific business needs in Canada?</strong></p>\n<p>As a CPA who uses both systems daily for our clients at LedgerLogic, I'll give you an honest breakdown—including where QuickBooks beats Xero (spoiler: payroll and reporting) and where Xero wins (interface, integrations, and multi-currency).</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"quick-verdict-at-a-glance\">Quick Verdict at a Glance</h2>\n<table class=\"table table-striped\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th>Xero</th>\n<th>QuickBooks Online</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Starting Price</strong></td>\n<td>$25/month (CAD)</td>\n<td>$20/month (CAD)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Users Included</strong></td>\n<td>2-10 depending on plan</td>\n<td>1-25 depending on plan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Built-in Payroll</strong></td>\n<td>No (requires add-on)</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong> (in Plus and above)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>GST/HST Compliance</strong></td>\n<td>Excellent</td>\n<td>Excellent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Multi-Currency</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Exceptional</strong></td>\n<td>Good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Phone Support</strong></td>\n<td>Email/chat only</td>\n<td><strong>Yes</strong> (on higher plans)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Free Receipt Capture</strong></td>\n<td>Hubdoc included</td>\n<td>Limited mobile</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Mobile App</strong></td>\n<td>Excellent</td>\n<td>Very good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Best For</strong></td>\n<td>E-commerce, consultants, international</td>\n<td>Service businesses, inventory, payroll-heavy</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />[[CTA_CONSULT]]\n<h2 id=\"pricing-comparison-the-real-cost\">Pricing Comparison: The Real Cost</h2>\n<h3 id=\"xero-pricing-february-2026\">Xero Pricing (February 2026)</h3>\n<p>Xero offers three plans in Canada:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Starter:</strong> $25/month (normally), <strong>now $2.50/month for 3 months</strong> (90% off promo until March 31, 2026)\n<ul>\n<li>20 invoices + 5 bills per month</li>\n<li>2 users</li>\n<li>Hubdoc included</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Standard:</strong> $55/month (normally), <strong>now $5.50/month for 3 months</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited invoices and bills</li>\n<li>5 users</li>\n<li>Multi-currency, projects, expense claims</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Premium:</strong> $75/month (normally), <strong>now $7.50/month for 3 months</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Everything in Standard</li>\n<li>10 users</li>\n<li>Multi-currency batch payments</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Hidden Costs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Payroll: Starts at <strong>$5/month per employee</strong> (Wave Payroll integration)</li>\n<li>No free phone support (email and chat only)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"quickbooks-online-pricing-february-2026\">QuickBooks Online Pricing (February 2026)</h3>\n<p>QuickBooks offers four main plans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simple Start:</strong> ~$20/month\n<ul>\n<li>1 user</li>\n<li>Basic invoicing and expense tracking</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Essentials:</strong> ~$40/month\n<ul>\n<li>3 users</li>\n<li>Bills, time tracking, multi-currency</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Plus:</strong> ~$60/month\n<ul>\n<li>5 users</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in payroll</strong> (up to 5 employees)</li>\n<li>Project tracking, inventory</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced:</strong> ~$120/month\n<ul>\n<li>25 users</li>\n<li>Advanced reporting, dedicated support</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Hidden Costs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Additional payroll employees: ~$5–10/month each beyond included limits</li>\n<li>Phone support only on higher plans</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-winner-tie\">The Winner: <strong>Tie</strong> (depends on your needs)</h3>\n<p>Xero is cheaper upfront if you're not hiring immediately. QuickBooks wins if you need payroll from day one.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"gst-hst-compliance-both-handle-it-well\">GST/HST Compliance: Both Handle It Well</h2>\n<p>As a CPA, this is non-negotiable: <strong>both Xero and QuickBooks handle Canadian sales tax properly.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"what-they-both-do-right\">What They Both Do Right:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Automated GST/HST calculation based on your province</li>\n<li>Support for multiple provincial rates (HST in Ontario, PST+GST in BC, etc.)</li>\n<li>Easy filing from within the platform</li>\n<li>Tax-inclusive and tax-exclusive pricing options</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"slight-edge-to-xero\">Slight Edge to Xero:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>More intuitive tax code setup if you're selling to multiple provinces</li>\n<li>Easier to track GST on international sales (common for exporters)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Both are compliant.

If you want granular control and don't mind a steeper learning curve, QuickBooks may suit you better.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"payroll-quickbooks-wins\">Payroll: QuickBooks Wins (Hands Down)</h2>\n<p>This is where QuickBooks pulls ahead significantly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quickbooks-payroll\">QuickBooks Payroll:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Built into Plus and Advanced plans</strong></li>\n<li>Automatic CRA remittances (CPP, EI, income tax)</li>\n<li>T4 generation at year-end</li>\n<li>Direct deposit included</li>\n<li>Provincial payroll tax compliance (Quebec, Ontario, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"xero-payroll\">Xero Payroll:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Not included</strong> in base plans</li>\n<li>Requires third-party integration (Wave Payroll, Rise, or Wagepoint)</li>\n<li>Additional cost: ~$5–$15/month per employee</li>\n<li>More setup friction</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> If payroll is a priority, <strong>QuickBooks wins.</strong> No contest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"integrations-xero-wins-on-app-ecosystem\">Integrations: Xero Wins on App Ecosystem</h2>\n<p>Xero has a more robust third-party app marketplace, especially for e-commerce and modern SaaS tools.</p>\n<h3 id=\"xero-integrations\">Xero Integrations:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1,000+ apps</strong> in the Xero App Marketplace</li>\n<li>Seamless connections with Shopify, WooCommerce, Amazon, Stripe</li>\n<li>Popular add-ons: Dext (receipt capture), Fathom (reporting), A2X (e-commerce accounting)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"quickbooks-integrations\">QuickBooks Integrations:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>650+ apps</strong></li>\n<li>Strong connections with traditional tools (Square, PayPal, Bill.com)</li>\n<li>Fewer modern e-commerce integrations</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Xero wins if you're running an e-commerce business or using cutting-edge SaaS tools.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"reporting-quickbooks-pulls-ahead\">Reporting: QuickBooks Pulls Ahead</h2>\n<p>QuickBooks offers more powerful out-of-the-box reporting, especially in Advanced plans.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quickbooks-reporting\">QuickBooks Reporting:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customizable reports</strong> (filter by class, location, customer)</li>\n<li>Profit &amp; Loss by class/department</li>\n<li>Strong inventory reports</li>\n<li>Better job costing</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"xero-reporting\">Xero Reporting:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Good standard reports (P&amp;L, balance sheet, aged receivables)</li>\n<li>Reporting is simpler but less customizable</li>\n<li>Requires third-party apps (Fathom, Spotlight) for advanced analytics</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> QuickBooks wins if you need detailed management reports or run a multi-location business.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"who-should-choose-xero\">Who Should Choose Xero?</h2>\n<p>Choose Xero if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run an <strong>e-commerce business</strong> (Shopify, Amazon, WooCommerce)</li>\n<li>Deal with <strong>multiple currencies</strong> regularly</li>\n<li>Want a <strong>cleaner, simpler interface</strong></li>\n<li>Don't need built-in payroll (or have &lt; 5 employees)</li>\n<li>Value <strong>app integrations</strong> with modern tools</li>\n<li>Are a <strong>consultant, freelancer, or agency</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>→ <a href=\"https://referrals.xero.com/qp622xbmjhis-q1e71\"><strong>Get 90% off Xero for 3 months (expires March 31, 2026)</strong></a></p>\n<p><em>As a Xero Certified Partner, LedgerLogic earns a commission when you sign up through our link—at no extra cost to you.

However, Xero currently offers <strong>90% off for 3 months</strong> (until March 31, 2026), making it cheaper initially. Long-term, pricing depends on the features you need.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-switch-from-quickbooks-to-xero-or-vice-versa\">Can I switch from QuickBooks to Xero (or vice versa)?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but it requires data migration. Most accountants (including LedgerLogic) offer migration services. Expect 2–5 hours of setup time depending on your transaction history.</p>\n<h3 id=\"does-xero-do-payroll-in-canada\">Does Xero do payroll in Canada?</h3>\n<p>Xero doesn't have built-in Canadian payroll. You'll need to integrate with Wave Payroll, Rise, or Wagepoint. Cost: ~$5–$15/month per employee.</p>\n<h3 id=\"which-is-better-for-e-commerce-businesses-in-canada\">Which is better for e-commerce businesses in Canada?</h3>\n<p><strong>Xero.</strong> It integrates seamlessly with Shopify, WooCommerce, Amazon, and A2X for automated reconciliation. QuickBooks works too, but the integration ecosystem is weaker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-canadian-accountants-prefer-xero-or-quickbooks\">Do Canadian accountants prefer Xero or QuickBooks?</h3>\n<p>It's split. Traditional accountants lean toward QuickBooks due to familiarity. Modern, cloud-forward firms (like LedgerLogic) prefer Xero for its interface and integrations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-xero-handle-gst-hst-for-multiple-provinces\">Can Xero handle GST/HST for multiple provinces?</h3>\n<p>Yes. Xero handles multi-provincial tax codes very well, making it ideal for businesses operating across Canada.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-quickbooks-better-for-inventory-management\">Is QuickBooks better for inventory management?</h3>\n<p>Yes. QuickBooks has more robust inventory tracking, especially in Plus and Advanced plans.</p>\n<h3 id=\"which-platform-has-better-customer-support-in-canada\">Which platform has better customer support in Canada?</h3>\n<p>QuickBooks offers <strong>phone support</strong> on Plus and Advanced plans. Xero only offers email and chat support. If phone support matters to you, QuickBooks wins.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Both Xero and QuickBooks are excellent accounting platforms for Canadian SMEs. Your choice should be based on <strong>your specific business needs</strong>, not which software is \"better\" in the abstract.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick decision guide:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>E-commerce, freelance, consulting?</strong> → <strong>Xero</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Service business with employees?</strong> → <strong>QuickBooks</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Still unsure?
