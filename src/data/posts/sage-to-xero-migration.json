    "content": "<p>Migrating from Sage 50 (Canada) to Xero is usually less about “moving software” and more about choosing the cleanest cutover point so your books stay reliable going forward. A good migration gives you:</p><ul><li>Clean opening balances that tie to your Sage trial balance</li><li>Correct <a href=\"/blog/gst-hst-tips-for-small-business-owners\">sales tax setup (GST/HST/PST)</a> for your business model</li><li>Bank feeds and reconciliation working smoothly from day one</li><li>A chart of accounts that’s simpler (and easier to keep clean)</li></ul><p>A bad migration does the opposite: it imports messy history, mismaps tax codes, and leaves you with “mystery balances” that never reconcile. This guide is designed to prevent that.</p><h2 id=\"overview-of-sage-to-xero-migration\">Overview of Sage to Xero Migration</h2><h3 id=\"benefits-of-converting\">Benefits of converting from Sage to Xero</h3><ul><li><strong>Real-time collaboration:</strong> Your accountant/bookkeeper can work in the same file without backups or file transfers.</li><li><strong>Bank feeds + faster month-end:</strong> Daily bank lines + reconciliation workflows typically reduce admin time.</li><li><strong>Cleaner app ecosystem:</strong> If you use tools like Shopify, Stripe, receipt capture, or payroll apps, <a href=\"/tools/xero-canada\">Xero integrates well</a>.</li><li><strong>More scalable workflow:</strong> Xero tends to fit better as transaction volume grows.</li></ul><h3 id=\"key-considerations\">Key considerations before you transfer</h3><p>Before you touch data, decide these three things:</p><ol><li><strong>How much history do you actually need in Xero?</strong><br>Most businesses don’t need years of detailed history inside Xero to run clean books.</li><li><strong>What’s the best conversion date?</strong><br>Picking the wrong date is the #1 reason migrations become painful.</li><li><strong>Who owns the tie-out?</strong><br>Someone must reconcile the new file to Sage (trial balance, bank recs, AR/AP). If no one does, errors persist.</li></ol><h2 id=\"pre-migration-preparation\">Pre-Migration Preparation</h2><p>A smooth migration is mostly preparation. If your Sage file is messy, Xero will faithfully import the mess.</p><h3 id=\"data-cleanup-in-sage\">Data cleanup in Sage (do this before exporting anything)</h3><ul><li>Reconcile bank and credit cards up to the conversion date.</li><li>Clear unapplied credits and old adjustments (especially in AR/AP).</li><li>Review your suspense/clearing accounts (if you have one, it will haunt you in Xero).</li><li>Confirm sales tax coding is consistent for the period you’re converting.</li></ul><p>If you’re behind on reconciliation or unsure about balances, fix that first. Migration is not the moment to “hope it works out.”</p><h3 id=\"chart-of-accounts-mapping\">Chart of accounts mapping (make Xero cleaner than Sage)</h3><p>Use the move as an opportunity to simplify:</p><ul><li>Merge duplicate/unused expense accounts</li><li>Standardize naming (e.g., “Bank Charges” vs “Service Fees”)</li><li>Confirm account types (assets/liabilities/equity/revenue/expense) are correct</li><li>Decide whether you’ll use <a href=\"/blog/can-i-use-xero-for-multiple-companies\">Tracking Categories</a> in Xero (departments/locations/projects)</li></ul><p>A simple mapping spreadsheet avoids import surprises.</p>[[CTA_CONSULT]]<h3 id=\"set-up-xero-environment\">Set up your Xero environment before importing</h3><p>Configure these upfront:</p><ul><li>financial year-end</li><li>sales tax settings (GST/HST/PST as needed)</li><li>tracking categories (if you’re using them)</li><li>user access/permissions</li></ul><p>Set this once correctly and you avoid rework later.</p><h2 id=\"xero-migration-process\">Xero Migration Process</h2><p>There are two common migration approaches. The right one depends on complexity and how clean your Sage file is.</p><h3 id=\"option-a-clean-cutover\">Option A: “Clean cutover” (recommended for many businesses)</h3><p>This is often the best balance of speed + accuracy. You migrate:</p><ul><li>contacts (customers/suppliers)</li><li>outstanding invoices (AR) and bills (AP) as of conversion date</li><li>opening balances (trial balance) as of conversion date</li></ul><p>You keep Sage as your historical archive (read-only).<br><strong>Best for:</strong> most service businesses, agencies, contractors, and any file with messy history.</p><h3 id=\"option-b-full-conversion\">Option B: “Full conversion” (selectively useful)</h3><p>You migrate months/years of transactions and history.<br><strong>Best for:</strong> businesses that truly need detailed transaction history inside Xero (rare) and have a clean Sage file.</p><h3 id=\"exporting-data-from-sage\">Exporting data from Sage (what you actually need)</h3><p><strong>Minimum exports most businesses need:</strong></p><ul><li>customer list and supplier list</li><li>chart of accounts</li><li>trial balance as of conversion date</li><li>AR aging and AP aging reports</li><li>bank reconciliation report(s) as of conversion date</li></ul><p><strong>Optional exports (only if relevant):</strong></p><ul><li>inventory valuation / item list</li><li>project/job summaries</li><li>sales by product/service breakdowns</li></ul><h3 id=\"importing-data-to-xero\">Importing data to Xero (sequence matters)</h3><p>A safe import order:</p><ol><li>set up org settings + sales tax + tracking</li><li>import chart of accounts</li><li>import contacts</li><li>import opening balances / conversion balances</li><li>add outstanding invoices and bills</li><li>connect bank feeds and reconcile forward</li></ol><h3 id=\"verifying-data-integrity\">Verifying data integrity (don’t skip this)</h3><p>Your goal is not “data is in Xero.” Your goal is “Xero matches Sage.” Verify:</p><ul><li><strong>Trial balance tie-out:</strong> Xero TB = Sage TB as of conversion date</li><li><strong>Bank tie-out:</strong> bank balances + reconciliation status align</li><li><strong>AR/AP tie-out:</strong> total receivables/payables match, and major customer/vendor balances look right</li><li><strong>Sales tax sanity check:</strong> the tax payable/receivable account matches expectation as of conversion date (especially if you convert mid-quarter)</li></ul><p>If anything doesn’t tie, stop and fix it before entering new activity.</p><h2 id=\"post-xero-migration-activities\">Post Xero Migration Activities</h2><p>Once the numbers tie, lock in your workflow so the file stays clean.</p><h3 id=\"reconciling-opening-balances\">Reconciling Xero opening balances</h3><p>Run a short checklist:</p><ul><li>bank/credit card balances match</li><li>loans and shareholder/owner balances match</li><li>GST/HST payable/receivable accounts are reasonable</li><li>retained earnings/equity looks correct (no unexplained plug amounts)</li></ul><h3 id=\"staff-training\">Staff training (what matters most)</h3><p>Focus training on:</p><ul><li>invoicing / bills and where to code things</li><li>reconciliation workflow + bank rules</li><li>attaching source docs (receipt capture process)</li><li>month-end checklist (so nothing drifts)</li></ul><p>If you are wondering about the learning curve, read our guide on <a href=\"/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-xero\">how long it takes to learn Xero</a>.</p><h3 id=\"addons-and-integrations\">Add-ons and integrations (do this after the core file is stable)</h3><p>Don’t integrate everything on day one. Start with:</p><ul><li>bank feeds + reconciliation working well</li><li>invoicing/bills consistent</li><li>then add e-commerce/payroll/receipt capture</li></ul><h2 id=\"troubleshooting-common-issues\">Troubleshooting Common Issues During Xero Migration</h2><p><strong>Issue: bank balances don’t match</strong><br>Most common causes: conversion date mismatch (Sage vs Xero), uncleared transactions in Sage, opening balance entered incorrectly.<br><strong>Fix:</strong> compare Sage bank rec report to Xero reconciliation screen at the conversion date.</p><p><strong>Issue: AR/AP totals don’t tie</strong><br>Most common causes: unapplied credits in Sage, outstanding invoices/bills not recreated correctly.<br><strong>Fix:</strong> tie to AR/AP aging totals, not just the trial balance line.</p><p><strong>Issue: taxes look wrong</strong><br>Most common causes: tax rates mapped incorrectly, tax inclusive vs exclusive differences, wrong tax account mapping.<br><strong>Fix:</strong> review Xero tax settings + ensure tax rates and tax accounts match your intended setup.</p><p><strong>Issue: chart of accounts is messy after import</strong><br><strong>Fix:</strong> simplify after the fact (merge/rename), but make sure you understand the impact on reporting first.</p><h2 id=\"maintaining-records\">Maintaining Financial Records in Xero</h2><p>To keep the new file reliable:</p><ul><li>reconcile bank/credit cards weekly</li><li>standardize coding rules (bank rules + clear account names)</li><li>do a simple month-end routine:<ul><li>reconcile accounts</li><li>review aged receivables/payables</li><li>scan for uncoded transactions</li><li>review key balance sheet accounts (taxes, loans, clearing accounts)</li></ul></li></ul><p>If you do those consistently, Xero stays clean and year-end becomes straightforward.</p><h2 id=\"faq\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>What’s the best conversion date?</h3><p>Usually the start of a fiscal year or the start of a GST/HST quarter. If you run payroll, also consider aligning with a payroll cycle to avoid mid-period confusion.</p><h3>Should I migrate full history or just opening balances?</h3><p>Most businesses are best served by a clean cutover: opening balances + outstanding AR/AP, and keeping Sage as historical reference. Full history migrations are more expensive and often import problems you don’t want.</p><h3>How long does a Sage to Xero migration take?</h3><p>A simple, clean file can be converted quickly. A messy file or one with inventory, multi-currency, or job costing can take longer because the tie-out and cleanup take time.</p><h3>What are the most common migration mistakes?</h3><p>Choosing a bad conversion date, skipping bank recs before converting, mismapping tax codes, importing too much history, and not doing a full tie-out to Sage.</p>",
