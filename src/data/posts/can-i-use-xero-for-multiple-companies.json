Your real estate holding company knows nothing about your operating company's bank feeds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"separate-orgs-vs-tracking-categories\">Critical Decision: Separate Org or Tracking Categories?</h3>\n<p>Before you start adding new organizations and paying for extra subscriptions, ask yourself: <strong>Is this actually a separate legal entity?</strong></p>\n<p>Use the decision tree below:</p>\n<div class=\"overflow-x-auto\">\n<table class=\"min-w-full bg-white border border-slate-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden\">\n<thead class=\"bg-slate-50\">\n<tr>\n<th class=\"py-3 px-4 text-left font-bold text-slate-700\">Scenario</th>\n<th class=\"py-3 px-4 text-left font-bold text-slate-700\">Recommendation</th>\n<th class=\"py-3 px-4 text-left font-bold text-slate-700\">Why?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody class=\"divide-y divide-slate-100\">\n<tr>\n<td class=\"py-3 px-4\">Separate Corporation (Inc.)</td>\n<td class=\"py-3 px-4 font-bold text-teal-600\">New Xero Organisation</td>\n<td class=\"py-3 px-4\">Separate tax return (T2) required.

Unfortunately, Xero doesn't have a \"Clone Organisation\" button, but you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Export the Chart of Accounts from Company A (Settings > Advanced > Chart of Accounts > Export).</li>\n<li>Import it into Company B.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-switch-organisations\">How to Switch Between Organisations</h2>\n<p>Once you have multiple companies set up, switching is instant.</p>\n<p>Just click the <strong>Organisation Name</strong> in the top-left corner and click the company you want to work on. There is <strong>no specialized login</strong> required. You can have multiple tabs open for different companies at the same time (just be careful not to enter data into the wrong one!).</p>\n<h2 id=\"costs-and-billing-canada\">Costs & Billing (Canada)</h2>\n<p>This is the most common question we get: <strong>\"Do I have to pay for a new subscription for every company?\"</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Yes.</strong> Xero charges per organisation.</p>\n<p>However, you don't necessarily need the top-tier plan for every entity. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operating Company:</strong> Likely needs <strong>Standard</strong> or <strong>Premium</strong> (for multicurrency).</li>\n<li><strong>Holding Company:</strong> Often only needs the <strong>Starter</strong> plan (approx $20-25 CAD/mo) if it has very few transactions (under 20 invoices/bills per month).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"exclusive-offer\">Exclusive Xero Offer</h3>\n<p>Since you are adding a <em>new</em> subscription, you are eligible for new customer promos.</p>\n<p>Managing your business finances can be challenging, but finding the right tools can make all the difference. That's why we're excited to share an exclusive offer: <strong>90% off Xero for 6 months</strong> with this <a href=\"https://xero5440.partnerlinks.io/lc4v5f7lmse2\"><strong>Xero partner link</strong></a>. This deal makes it easier than ever to simplify your accounting while saving money.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://xero5440.partnerlinks.io/lc4v5f7lmse2\"><strong>Get 90% off Xero for 6 months</strong></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"consolidated-reporting\">Consolidated Reporting (Group Views)</h2>\n<p>If you own 3 companies, you probably want to see a \"Group\" Profit & Loss.</p>\n<p>Xero has extremely basic consolidation features effectively only available if you share the exact same base currency and chart of accounts. For 99% of Canadian business owners, <strong>Xero's native consolidation is not enough</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-solution-joiin\">The Solution: Joiin</h3>\n<p>For consolidated reporting, we strongly recommend an app called <strong>Joiin</strong>. It connects to all your Xero files and produces beautiful, consolidated Board Reports, eliminations, and multi-currency conversions automatically.</p>\n<h2 id=\"common-pitfalls\">Common Pitfalls</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>paying for full subscriptions on dormant corps:</strong> If a corporation is inactive, cancel the Xero sub and just keep the PDF records. Don't pay $50/mo for a zero-transaction file.</li>\n<li><strong>Mixing funds:</strong> Just because you can access both companies from one login doesn't mean you can transfer money freely without recording it. Every transfer between Company A and Company B must be recorded as an <strong>Intercompany Loan</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bank Feeds:</strong> You must connect the distinct bank account for Company B to Company B's Xero file. You cannot feed Company B's bank data into Company A's Xero file.</li>\n</ul>[[CTA_LEAD_MAGNET]]\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<dl>\n<dt class=\"font-bold text-slate-900\">Can I share my Xero login with my business partner?</dt>\n<dd class=\"mb-4 text-slate-600\">No. You should never share passwords. Instead, invite your partner as a user into each organisation. It is free to add unlimited users.</dd>\n<dt class=\"font-bold text-slate-900\">Does Xero give a discount for multiple companies?</dt>\n<dd class=\"mb-4 text-slate-600\">Xero sometimes offers \"Multi-org discounts\" but typically only if you have a huge number of files (like a franchise). For most owners with 2-3 corps, using the <a href=\"https://xero5440.partnerlinks.io/lc4v5f7lmse2\">New Subscriber Promo</a> for each new file is the best way to save.</dd>\n<dt class=\"font-bold text-slate-900\">Can I merge two Xero organisations later?</dt>\n<dd class=\"mb-4 text-slate-600\">No. You cannot merge two files into one. If you made a mistake and created two orgs for the same company, you have to choose one and manually move the data, then delete the other.</dd>\n</dl>",
