## Are Dividends Taxable in Canada


In Canada, dividends are taxable, but there is a dividend tax credit system in place that provides tax advantages for Canadian residents who receive dividends from Canadian businesses. T


he dividend tax rate in Canada depends on the type of dividends you receive, whether they are eligible or non-eligible dividends. Eligible dividends are taxed at a lower rate than non-eligible dividends.


Additionally, if you receive dividends from foreign corporations, you may be subject to withholding taxes imposed by the country where the corporation is based. It's important to seek professional advice from a qualified tax advisor or financial planner to navigate the complexities of the dividend tax in Canada.


## How Are Canadian Dividends Taxed in Canada


Canadian dividends income is generally taxable in the year it is received. Canadian residents benefit from tax advantages on dividends from Canadian businesses via the dividend tax credit system.


This system aims to prevent double taxation by providing a credit for taxes paid at the corporate level. Foreign dividends received from foreign corporations are also subject to taxation at the investor's highest marginal rate. However, the overall taxes paid on that income may be reduced by a foreign tax credit.


## Types of Dividends: Eligible vs. Non-Eligible


There are two main types of dividends that shareholders can receive: eligible dividends and non-eligible dividends.


Canada eligible dividends are paid out by large Canadian businesses that pay higher corporate taxes. Meanwhile, non-eligible dividends are paid out by smaller Canadian private corporations that pay corporate tax at a lower rate.


The tax treatment of these Canadian dividends differs, with eligible dividends being taxed more favorably due to an enhanced dividend tax credit.


### Eligible Dividends


Eligible dividends are taxed at a lower rate compared to non-eligible dividends. When eligible dividends are paid, they are "grossed up" by a certain percentage to reflect the corporate income that was earned.


This grossed-up amount is then given an enhanced dividend tax credit to account for the higher corporate tax already paid. The federal tax rate on eligible dividends in Canada is 15.0198%.


### Non-Eligible Dividends


Non-eligible dividends, also known as regular dividends, are taxed at a higher rate than eligible dividends. These dividends are paid by Canadian private corporations that benefit from lower tax rates.


Non-eligible dividends have a lower gross-up rate and reduced dividend tax credit compared to eligible dividends. The federal tax rate on non-eligible dividends is 9.0301%.


### Provincial Dividend Tax Credit


In addition to federal taxation, dividend taxation in Canada also involves provincial tax rates. Each province has its own dividend tax credit rates for eligible and non-eligible dividends.


For example, in British Columbia, the dividend tax credit for eligible dividends is 12%, while for non-eligible dividends, it is 2.18%. The rates vary across provinces, so it's important to consult the specific rates for your province.


## How Are Foreign Dividends Taxed in Canada?


Dividends received from foreign companies are subject to different tax rules. No dividend tax credit is applied because the foreign company issuing the dividend did not pay taxes to Canada.


The taxation of foreign dividends includes a withholding tax, which varies from country to country.


However, tax treaties between countries may reduce or eliminate these withholding taxes, so it's important to consult with a tax professional to understand your specific obligations. It's important to note that the withholding tax is not available if you hold your foreign dividends in registered accounts.


## How Are US Dividends Taxed in Canada?


When a Canadian taxpayer receives dividend income from U.S. sources, this income is subject to taxation in Canada. However, thanks to the Canada-U.S. Tax Treaty, the tax rate on these dividends is typically reduced. For Canadian residents, the foreign dividends must be reported on their Canadian income tax return in Canadian dollars.


The treaty reduces the U.S. withholding tax to 15% for most Canadian residents, which can be credited against the Canadian tax owing on that income to avoid double taxation. It's important to note that U.S. dividends do not qualify for the Canadian Dividend Tax Credit, which is available for dividends received from Canadian corporations.


Therefore, the grossed-up amount and tax credit do not apply to U.S. dividends. For precise calculations and to understand how this impacts your individual tax situation, it's advisable to consult with a qualified tax professional.


## Tax-Free Dividends in Canada


### No Tax on Dividend Income if Income Below a Certain Threshold


While dividends are generally taxable in Canada, there are certain scenarios where dividends can be tax-free. If dividends are your only form of income and you meet specific criteria, you may be eligible for tax-free dividends.


For example, as a single person with no other income, you can earn up to a certain amount in eligible dividends before having to pay federal taxes. The exact threshold may vary, so it's essential to consult the current tax regulations.


Additionally, dividends from certain tax-exempt securities, such as those from mutual funds or regulated investment companies, may also be tax-free.


### Capital Dividends


A capital gain dividend is a type of dividend paid to shareholders from the non-taxable portion of capital gains generated by a corporation, rather than from the corporation's earnings. They are typically paid when a corporation disposes of certain assets, such as real estate or investments, resulting in a capital gain.


Capital gains dividends can be paid tax-free because they are not considered taxable income to the recipient. This is because the capital gains tax has already been paid by the corporation when the assets were sold.


The non-taxable portion of capital gains (50%) is added to a capital dividend account, or [CDA account.](https://ledgerlogic.ca/2023/12/27/capital-dividend-account-example/) This can be then be used to distribute the dividends to the shareholders of a corporation on a tax-free basis.


In order to pay capital dividends, an election to pay capital dividends has to be made in prescribed form by completing CRA form [T2054](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2054.html)[.](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2054.html) Additional documents documents are also required under this election. More information can be obtained by reviewing [Income Tax Folio S3-F2-C1, Capital Dividends](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-3-property-investments-savings-plans/series-3-property-investments-savings-plan-folio-2-dividends/income-tax-folio-s3-f2-c1-capital-dividends.html) or by [Booking a Free Consultation with LedgerLogic](https://calendly.com/ledgerlogic/free-consultation-30-min?back=1&month=2023-09).


Capital dividends can be an effective way for corporations to distribute funds to shareholders without them incurring additional tax liabilities.


## The Benefits of Paying Yourself Dividends


Many professionals choose to pay themselves in dividends from their corporations. There are several reasons why this strategy is popular:


1. ****Simplicity****: Paying yourself dividends is relatively straightforward and doesn't require setting up payroll or making CPP contributions.
2. ****Lower Personal Tax Rate****: Dividends are taxed at a lower rate compared to employment income. However, it is important to consider additional taxes paid at the corporate level when comparing whether [salary or dividends](https://ledgerlogic.ca/2023/11/21/is-it-better-to-pay-yourself-a-salary-or-dividends-in-canada/) is more advantageous overall. Generally, Canadian tax integration should result in similar overall tax liability between salary and dividends.
3. ****Income Splitting****: If your spouse is a shareholder and works in the business, they can receive dividends, potentially reducing your overall household tax rate.


While paying yourself dividends offers advantages, it's important to consider potential [disadvantages and complexities](https://ledgerlogic.ca/2023/11/21/is-it-better-to-pay-yourself-a-salary-or-dividends-in-canada/), such as limited RRSP contribution room, no ability to deduct child care expenses, lack of CPP benefits, and the inability to deduct dividends as a business expense.


Consulting with a financial advisor can help you determine if this strategy is right for your specific circumstances.


## Understanding the Dividend Tax Credit


The dividend tax credit in Canada is a mechanism designed to provide tax relief to Canadian residents who receive eligible dividends. This federal dividend tax credit offsets the taxes already paid by the corporation at the corporate level.


The amount of the dividend tax credit depends on the nature of the dividends (eligible vs. non-eligible) as well as your province of residence since it is affected by the amount of taxes paid at the corporate level.


## Tax Planning Considerations


When it comes to dividend taxation in Canada, there are several factors to consider for effective tax planning. Here are a few key considerations:


### Integration


The Canadian tax system aims to achieve integration, meaning that regardless of how taxable income flows through corporations and businesses to individuals, the overall tax rate remains consistent.


This is why eligible and non-eligible dividends, dividend gross-up, and dividend tax credits exist. Understanding the concept of integration can help you optimize your tax planning strategies.


### Capital Gains Tax


It's important to differentiate between dividends and capital gains when it comes to investment income taxation. Capital gains are realized when you sell a security for more than its purchase price, and they are taxed at a different rate.


While both dividends and capital gains have lower tax rates compared to other forms of income, dividends generally have the lowest tax rate. It's crucial to consider the tax implications of both types of investment income when planning your investments.


### Registered Accounts


Registered accounts, such as RRSPs and TFSAs, offer tax advantages for dividend income. Dividends earned within these accounts are either tax-deferred until withdrawal (RRSPs) or entirely tax-free (TFSAs).


By strategically utilizing registered accounts, you can optimize your tax position and maximize your investment returns.


### Income Splitting


[Income splitting](https://ledgerlogic.ca/2023/09/28/how-does-income-splitting-work-in-canada/) refers to the strategy of allocating income among family members to reduce the overall tax burden. You can split income with a spouse who's a shareholder and active in your business by paying them dividends


However, it's important to ensure that you comply with tax regulations and consult with a tax professional for personalized advice.

3. ****Claim the Dividend Tax Credit****: Calculate and claim the dividend tax credit based on the grossed-up amount of eligible dividends received. The CRA provides tables and formulas to assist with this calculation.
4. ****Report Foreign Dividends:**** If you received dividends from foreign companies, report them on Line 12100 of your tax return. Foreign dividends do not qualify for the Canadian dividend tax credit and are taxed as regular income.
