The Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax ([GST/HST](https://ledgerlogic.ca/category/sales-tax/)) Quick Method is a simplified accounting option available to small business owners in Canada. It provides an alternative approach to managing GST/HST that can lead to savings in both time and potentially taxes owed to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). By allowing businesses to remit a fixed percentage of their gross income, which is often less than the standard rates of GST/HST charged, the Quick Method reduces the complexity of tax calculations associated with the traditional method.

Many entrepreneurs find the traditional method of tracking every input credit and tax collected cumbersome and time-consuming. The Quick Method caters to this concern by streamlining the process. Businesses opting for this method can calculate their [GST/HST tax remittance](https://ledgerlogic.ca/2023/11/06/how-do-i-file-a-gsthst-return-in-canada-a-step-by-step-guide/) by applying a lower remittance rate to their total revenue, which includes the GST/HST collected. Additionally, eligible businesses can benefit from a 1% credit on the first $30,000 of taxable supplies each fiscal year. This simplification often translates into lower overall remittance figures, thereby saving money for the business.

It is important for businesses to review their eligibility and the potential financial impact the Quick Method may have on their operations. While the simplicity and potential savings are appealing, each business situation is unique, and what constitutes a savings opportunity for one may not work for another. Considering these factors carefully ensures that businesses make an informed decision that aligns with their financial interests.
## Understanding the GST/HST Quick Method


The GST/HST Quick Method represents a streamlined approach for small businesses to manage tax remittance, offering a simplified calculation process and potential financial savings.
### Eligibility Criteria


To utilize the GST/HST Quick Method, a business must meet specific criteria. The total taxable sales (including the GST/HST and zero-rated supplies) of the business and associated persons must not exceed CAD $400,000 in the fiscal year. This threshold applies to the worldwide taxable supplies of the business and its associates. Certain businesses, such as accountants, financial consultants, or law firms may not be eligible.
### Benefits of the Quick Method


Employing the Quick Method can confer several advantages:
1. **Simplified accounting**: Reduces the need to track and report the actual GST/HST paid or payable on most purchases.
2. **Reduced paperwork**: Lessens the administrative burden, streamlining tax time processes.
3. **Potential tax savings**: Businesses can remit tax at a lower rate than the standard GST/HST rate. For instance, a small business might charge the standard 5% GST but only remit a portion of that percent to the CRA.
4. **Cash flow perks**: Entrepreneurs may retain a portion of the GST/HST collected, which can improve cash flow for their operations.


Employing the Quick Method can be especially beneficial for businesses with low input tax credits relative to their GST/HST output tax.
## Registering for the GST/HST Quick Method


The GST/HST Quick Method is a streamlined accounting option that allows businesses to save time and potentially reduce tax payments. It's crucial for potential registrants to understand the application process and adhere to registration deadlines.
### Application Process


Business owners must first determine their eligibility for the Quick Method by reviewing the criteria set forth by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). If eligible, they can [register for the Quick Method](https://ledgerlogic.ca/2023/09/24/when-and-how-do-i-register-for-gst/) either online through their CRA My Business Account, by mail, or by fax. The registration form, [GST74](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst74.html), must be completed and submitted to the CRA. Required details include:
* Business number (BN)
* Reporting period
* Effective date of election


### Deadlines for Registration


For the Quick Method registration to be effective for a specific fiscal year, the business must submit their application:
* No later than the first day of the second fiscal quarter
* Or, within the first month of a business owner's tax year if they are a sole proprietor


It's important to note that late applications may result in the business having to wait until the next fiscal year for the method to apply.
## Calculating Your Taxes Using the Quick Method


When utilizing the Quick Method for GST/HST, businesses are able to streamline tax calculations. Specific remittance rates apply and can result in tax savings.
### Determining Your Quick Method Percentage


The initial step in the Quick Method is to ascertain the [remittance rate assigned by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4058/quick-method-accounting-gst-hst.html#P225_18783). Rates vary depending on whether a business provides goods or services and the province in which it operates. For some businesses, the CRA offers a 1% credit on the first $30,000 of taxable supplies, further reducing the amount owed.

*Remittance Rates:*
* **For services**: The rate is generally lower than for goods.
* **For goods**: The rate is dependent on the category of goods sold.
* **By province**: Each province has specific rates that need to be applied.


### Applying the Quick Method to Sales


Once the appropriate remittance rate is identified, a business should apply it to their total revenue, including GST/HST, for the remittance period. The outcome is the tax amount to remit to the CRA.

**Example Calculation:**
For taxable sales including GST/HST of $10,000:
1. **Total Sales (Including GST/HST)**: $10,000
2. **GST/HST Remittance**: $10,000 * (Quick Method Rate) - $100 (1% credit on the first $30,000 of sales - $20,000 in sales still eligible for future quarters)


It's crucial to note that a business using the Quick Method collects GST/HST at the standard rate from its customers but remits at the reduced Quick Method rate, which may lead to tax savings.
## Reporting and Remittances


The GST/HST Quick Method simplifies the tax remittance process by allowing qualifying businesses to use reduced rates and less detailed tracking of inputs.
### Filling Out Tax Forms


Business owners must accurately complete their GST/HST tax forms using the Quick Method. To report GST/HST collected:
* **Total Taxable Sales Revenue (including GST/HST):** Calculate this figure for the reporting period.
* **Quick Method Remittance Rates:** Use the predetermined remittance rates applicable to the business's province or territory.


The amount of GST/HST remittance is determined by multiplying the Taxable Sales Revenue by the applicable Quick Method Remittance Rate.
### Payment Schedules


The frequency of GST/HST payments varies depending on the business's revenue and the payment schedule assigned by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA):
* **Monthly, Quarterly, or Annual Remittances:** Businesses must adhere to their designated filing frequency, with specific due dates for each period.


It is crucial for businesses to follow their assigned payment schedule to remain compliant and avoid potential penalties.
## Record-Keeping Requirements


When utilizing the GST/HST Quick Method, businesses must adequately maintain records that support their tax calculations. **Accuracy** and **completeness** are critical. Here is a structured outline of what is required:
* Sales invoices or receipts must be kept to substantiate the total revenue that includes GST/HST and zero-rated supplies. These should clearly state the date and amount of each transaction.
* Documentation for the purchase of goods and services for business operations, even though input tax credits cannot be claimed on most expenses under the Quick Method, is essential to establish your eligibility and for CRA audit purposes.
* Financial records such as bank statements, ledgers, and journals will trace the flow of money in and out of the business and must be maintained.


A detailed log for special situations, such as business-related mileage or home office use, is necessary if they affect the tax calculation under the Quick Method. These specific records help in determining the appropriate use of the 1% credit on the first $30,000 of eligible supplies each fiscal year.
### Essential Record Details:


* **Entity Information:** Name, address, and GST/HST registration number.
* **Duration**: Maintain records for a period of at least six years from the end of the last fiscal year they relate to.


Remember, failure to keep these records may result in penalties and possibly negate the benefits of using the Quick Method. It's imperative that a company's record-keeping is systematic and in compliance with the requirements laid out by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
## Quick Method and Input Tax Credits


The Quick Method is a simplified accounting option that allows eligible businesses to remit a reduced amount of GST/HST. Normally, businesses collect GST/HST from their customers and deduct the GST/HST paid on their purchases as an **Input Tax Credit (ITC)**. However, under the Quick Method, businesses calculate their remittance by applying a predetermined rate on their taxable supplies and do not claim the ITCs on most purchases.
### Key Points:


* **ITCs:** Regular method users deduct GST/HST paid on their business expenses and inputs from the GST/HST they collect from customers.
* **Quick Method Rates:** The business remits GST/HST at a lower rate than the standard rate it collects, which could lead to savings.
* **Eligible Supplies:** A 1% credit on the first $30,000 of taxable supplies each year applies under this method, enhancing savings.
* **Ineligible for ITCs:** Most ITCs cannot be claimed, except on capital expenditures or if the business is a reseller of goods.
* **Savings Potential:** Typically benefits service-based businesses where purchases are minimal and GST/HST on expenses cannot be fully recovered.


Businesses should evaluate if the Quick Method is advantageous for their particular financial situation. The Quick Method often results in tax savings for certain service-oriented businesses where salaries and wages form the bulk of expenses and the GST/HST paid on inputs is low. However, it is important to assess individual circumstances, considering the ineligible supplies and restrictions on claiming ITCs, to determine if this method suits their financial strategy.
## Changes to Your Business and the Quick Method


Business owners should note that adjustments to the Quick Method rates and the decision to opt out can significantly affect GST/HST reporting and potential savings.
### Adjusting Quick Method Rates


The Quick Method rates may vary depending on the business's annual taxable sales and the type of goods or services provided. Specific rates are applied to the revenue to calculate the remittance amount. For example, a rate of **8.8%** might be applied for a services business located in a province with a HST rate of 13%. Meanwhile, a business located in a province where only a 5% GST applies (i.e. Alberta) would have a Quick Method rate of 3.6%.
### Opting Out of the Quick Method


Businesses have the option to opt out of the Quick Method at the end of any fiscal year if they find the method does not align with their business needs. The decision to opt out must be made before the due date of the return for the last reporting period in the fiscal year for which regular GST/HST reporting is preferred. It's important for businesses to evaluate their accounting practices and the impact on cash flow and administrative costs to determine if the standard GST/HST accounting method may be more beneficial.

**Steps to Opt Out:**
1. Determine the last reporting period in your fiscal year.
2. Opt out before the due date of the GST/HST return for that period.
3. Notify CRA by completing the appropriate form or through My Business Account.


Businesses should consult with a tax professional or accountant when considering changes to their GST/HST reporting method to ensure compliance with the Canada Revenue Agency's regulations and to maximize their tax benefits.
