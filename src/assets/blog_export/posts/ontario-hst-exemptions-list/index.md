The [Harmonized Sales Tax](https://ledgerlogic.ca/category/sales-tax/) (HST) is a combined federal and provincial tax applicable to most goods and services in Ontario. However, there are exemptions to this tax, which means certain items and services are not subject to HST. Understanding the scope of these exemptions can help individuals and businesses make well-informed decisions about their purchases and the taxes they are expected to pay.

Some examples of goods and services on the Ontario HST exemption list include health, medical, and dental services provided by licensed physicians and dentists for medical reasons. With a variety of HST exempt items, consumers and business owners can benefit from being aware of these exemptions and planning their expenses accordingly.

In addition to these exemptions, it is essential to be aware of false GST/HST exemption claims and counterfeit exemption cards. By being knowledgeable about the HST exemptions in Ontario and recognizing potential fraudulent activities, individuals and businesses can better navigate the tax system and make informed decisions.
## Overview of HST in Ontario


In Ontario, the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) is a combination of the federal goods and services tax (GST) and the provincial sales tax. Currently, the [HST rate](https://ledgerlogic.ca/2023/12/18/canadian-corporate-tax-rates-by-province/) stands at **13%**. It came into effect on July 1, 2010, replacing the 5% GST and 8% RST on most goods and services in the province.

HST applies to a wide range of goods and services; however, certain goods and services are exempt. This means that businesses in Ontario do not collect HST on these exempt items, and consequently, are not required to [remit the tax](https://ledgerlogic.ca/2023/11/06/how-do-i-file-a-gsthst-return-in-canada-a-step-by-step-guide/).

Examples of HST-exempt goods and services in Ontario are as follows:
* Health, medical, and dental services provided by licensed physicians and dentists for medical reasons
* Most educational services, such as vocational and college courses
* Childcare services
* Long-term rentals
* Legal aid services


It is essential for businesses and consumers in Ontario to be aware of the HST exemption list. This knowledge helps businesses maintain their compliance with tax regulations, while consumers understand their rights and responsibilities related to the taxes they pay.

### Basic Groceries


Items considered as basic groceries are exempt from HST. These include most unprocessed food products such as fresh fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, and fish. Processed foods such as snack foods and carbonated beverages do not fall under this category and are subject to HST.
### Prescription Drugs


Prescription drugs are considered zero-rated supplies when they are prescribed by a licensed healthcare provider and dispensed by a pharmacist. Any over-the-counter (OTC) medications and vitamins are subject to HST unless they are specifically prescribed by a healthcare professional.
### Medical Devices


Most medical devices, such as hearing aids, artificial limbs, and walking aids, are exempt from HST when prescribed by a medical practitioner for a patient's use. This also includes medical equipment that is necessary for the patient's treatment or mobility.
### Books


Printed books, audio recordings of printed books, and electronic books (e-books) are generally exempt from HST. This includes textbooks, children's books, and literary works. Magazines, newspapers, and periodicals, however, are still subject to HST.
### Children's Goods


Clothing and footwear designed for children under 14 years of age are exempt from HST. This includes baby garments, children's hats, gloves, and outerwear. Children's car seats and booster seats are also exempt from HST.
### Feminine Hygiene Products


Feminine hygiene products, such as tampons, pads, and menstrual cups, are exempt from HST in Ontario to make them more accessible and affordable for those who need them.
### Agricultural Products


Agricultural products, including livestock, poultry, and raw wool, are exempt from HST. Farm equipment and machinery used for agricultural purposes may also qualify for HST exemption depending on certain criteria.

These general exemptions aim to make essential goods and services more accessible to Ontario residents.

## Property and Real Estate Exemptions


### Residential Rentals


Long-term residential rentals, defined as rentals for a continuous period of one month or more, are **exempt** from HST in Ontario. This includes renting out residential properties such as houses, apartments, and condominiums. However, short-term rentals, like those often found on platforms such as Airbnb, are still subject to HST as they are considered a supply of accommodation.
### Sales of Used Residential Housing


In Ontario, the sale of used residential properties is typically **exempt** from HST. This means that when individuals sell their homes, they generally do not need to collect and remit HST as part of the transaction. It's essential to note that this exemption only applies to used residential properties and does not include newly built homes or commercial properties.
### Certain Real Property Transactions


Some specific real property transactions may also qualify for HST exemption. For example, sales of personal-use vacant land are typically exempt from HST. Personal-use vacant land refers to land that is not used for commercial purposes, such as farming or generating income. Additionally, specific transfers of real property between closely related parties, such as family members or corporations under common control, can be exempt from HST if certain conditions are met. In these cases, it's vital to consult a tax professional to ensure eligibility for the exemption.
