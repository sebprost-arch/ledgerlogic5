When taxpayers in Canada disagree with an assessment or decision made by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), they have the right to lodge a formal dispute through a notice of objection. This legal recourse allows individuals and corporations to contest a variety of issues, such as income tax, the Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST), decisions related to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), or Employment Insurance (EI). The objection acts as the first step in the appeals process, providing a structured path for taxpayers to have their cases reviewed and reassessed by the CRA.

The process of filing an objection is outlined by the CRA, with clear steps to ensure taxpayers understand their rights and the procedures to follow. Taxpayers must adhere to established time limits, providing their objection within 90 days from the date the notice of assessment or decision was mailed to them. In some cases, an extension is possible but conditions apply. The CRA obligates the taxpayer to include specific information with the objection in order to facilitate a comprehensive review of the dispute.

The outcome of an objection can lead to adjustments in the taxpayer's favor or uphold the original decision, depending on the CRA's evaluation of the presented arguments and evidence. If the taxpayer remains unsatisfied with the outcome of the objection, there are further avenues for appeal, including the Tax Court of Canada, which represents the next level of dispute resolution.
## Understanding the Notice of Objection


When a taxpayer disagrees with a decision made by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), they have the right to file a Notice of Objection. This formal document starts the process of reviewing the CRA's assessment or reassessment.
### Purpose and Legal Basis


The purpose of a Notice of Objection is to provide taxpayers with a means to contest the CRA's assessment or determination regarding their taxes. Legally established under Canada's Income Tax Act, it triggers a formal and impartial review by the CRA’s Appeals Division or, ultimately, by the courts. The goal is to ensure that taxpayers are assessed and taxed correctly, according to the laws governing Canadian taxation.
### Eligibility to File a Notice


To file a Notice of Objection, the individual must be a taxpayer who has received a Notice of Assessment or Reassessment with which they disagree. They may object to the CRA's calculation of tax, the imposition of penalties, or other determinations made under the Income Tax Act. Both individuals and corporations are entitled to object, provided they do so within the designated time limit specified by the CRA, generally within 90 days from the date the Notice of Assessment or Reassessment was sent.
## Preparing to File an Objection


When an individual or corporation decides to contest a decision made by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), preparing a Notice of Objection is an essential step. It requires gathering the right documentation, understanding filing deadlines, and knowing what the assessment review process entails.
### Required Documentation


To file an objection, one needs:
* A completed Form T400A, Objection – Income Tax Act, or a signed letter stating the decision they want to review and the relevant facts and reasons. This can be filed through My Account or My Business Account by a taxpayer or their representative.
* Supporting documents relevant to the objection, such as receipts, books, records, or other pertinent information that substantiate the claim.


### Deadlines for Filing


For ***individuals***, the deadline to file a Notice of Objection is **one year** from the tax return filing due date or **90 days** after the date of the Notice of Assessment or Reassessment, whichever is later. The specific dates are as follows:

For [***corporations***](https://ledgerlogic.ca/2023/11/03/tax-benefits-and-disadvantages-of-incorporating-in-canada/), the Notice of Objection must be filed within **90 days** of the date on the Notice of Assessment or Reassessment.
### Assessment Review Process


Once an objection is filed, the CRA conducts a thorough review which includes:
* An impartial examination of the assessment or determination under dispute.
* Consideration of all information available, including any new evidence presented in support of the objection.


During this process, the CRA might request additional information or clarification. It's imperative for the taxpayer to respond to these requests to avoid delays in the assessment review process.
## Submission Process


When filing a Notice of Objection with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), a taxpayer has two main methods of submission: digitally through electronic services or via traditional paper-based filing. Each method has specific requirements that must be adhered to in order to ensure a valid submission.
### Electronic Submission Methods


Taxpayers can object to a CRA Notice of Assessment or Notice of Reassessment electronically using the CRA’s online services. **My Account**, **My Business Account**, and **Represent a Client** are the primary portals provided by the CRA for individuals, businesses, and tax representatives respectively. To submit electronically, one must:
* Log in to their respective CRA account.
* Navigate to the "Submit documents" section.
* Complete the necessary fields and attach the Notice of Objection form and any supporting documents.


**Note:** The CRA's online submission service is available 21 hours a day and is closed daily from 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) for maintenance.
### Paper Submission Requirements


For those who choose or need to submit their objection on paper, the CRA requires the following:
* A completed **Form T400A**, Objection – Income Tax Act, or a signed letter providing the same information requested on the form.
* Details of why the assessment or determination is incorrect, including all relevant facts.
* Any additional documentation or evidence to support the objection.


The paper documents should be sent to the tax center listed on the notice of assessment or reassessment. It’s crucial for the taxpayer to keep copies of all submitted materials for their records.
## After Filing an Objection


When a taxpayer files an objection to a notice of assessment from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), they embark on a formal review process. The objection sets the stage for the CRA to reconsider its initial assessment.
### CRA's Acknowledgment of Receipt


After an objection is filed, the CRA will acknowledge receipt of the objection. Taxpayers will typically receive confirmation within 30 days. This acknowledgment will often contain information such as the file number associated with the objection and an estimated timeline for when a review will be completed.
### Possible Outcomes of an Objection


An objection may result in several potential outcomes:
* **Vacate**: The CRA agrees entirely with the taxpayer's objection and adjusts the assessment accordingly.
* **Vary**: The CRA agrees with the taxpayer on some points, leading to a revised assessment.
* **Confirm**: The CRA does not find the objection valid and maintains the original notice of assessment.


It's important for taxpayers to be prepared for any of these scenarios.
### Communications with the CRA


Taxpayers can expect communications from the CRA during the review process. It's critical for them to respond to requests for additional information in a timely manner. Any correspondence from the CRA should reference the file number of the objection. Regular updates on the status of the objection may also be available through the CRA's online services.
## Resolving Disputes


When taxpayers disagree with a notice of assessment from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), they have options to resolve the dispute. These range from informal resolutions to formal appeals.
### Informal Resolution Options


Taxpayers should first attempt to **resolve disputes informally** by contacting the CRA directly. This approach allows for clarification or correction without immediately resorting to formal procedures.
* **Contacting CRA**: Reach out via phone or written correspondence.
* **Review**: A CRA agent will reassess the specific tax issue raised.


### Formal Appeals Process


If initial conversations do not resolve the issue, taxpayers may file a **Formal Notice of Objection**. This initiates the formal appeals process with the CRA.
1. **Filing an Objection**: Must be submitted within 90 days of receiving the notice of assessment.
2. **Online Submission**: Taxpayers can file objections through the CRA website and immediately receive a case number.
3. **Supporting Documents**: Essential to submit relevant documents to substantiate the objection.


The CRA reviews the submitted objection and makes a determination. If the taxpayer disagrees with this decision, they can appeal to the Tax Court of Canada.
## Understanding Your Rights


When it comes to resolving tax disputes in Canada, taxpayers are afforded specific rights under the Income Tax Act. Understanding these rights is crucial for any taxpayer faced with an objection to a CRA decision.
### Taxpayer Bill of Rights


The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) adheres to a Taxpayer Bill of Rights that ensures fair treatment and provision of information to taxpayers. Here are some of the key rights related to objections:
1. **Right to Service in the Official Language of Choice**: Taxpayers have the option to communicate and receive services in English or French.
2. **Right to Privacy and Confidentiality**: Taxpayer information is protected and only shared in accordance with the law.
3. **Right to Formal Review and a Fair and Impartial Appeal Process**: If taxpayers disagree with an assessment, they have the right to file an objection and receive an impartial review.


### Access to Information


Taxpayers have the right to access their personal information held by the CRA and to verify its accuracy and completeness. This is instrumental when preparing a Notice of Objection as it involves:
* **Review of Assessment Details**: Taxpayers can request documentation explaining the CRA's assessment or reassessment.
* **Clear and Accurate Records**: Access to their tax records helps taxpayers provide precise information in their objection.


The CRA is committed to providing accessible services, including alternative formats for information, such as braille or MP3, for individuals with visual impairments.
## Record Keeping


When filing a Notice of Objection with the CRA, it is essential to maintain accurate records. A comprehensive approach to document retention and proof of submission ensures that taxpayers are prepared for any inquiries or [audits](https://ledgerlogic.ca/2023/09/09/how-do-you-deal-with-a-cra-audit/).
### Document Retention Policies


Taxpayers should adhere to strict document retention policies. It is advised that all relevant financial records and tax documents be kept for a minimum of **six years** from the end of the last tax year they relate to. This period aligns with the CRA's requirement for record keeping.

**Key documents include:**
* Notices of Assessment and Reassessment
* Tax returns filed
* Supporting documents (receipts, invoices, financial statements, and logs)


### Proof of Submission


When a Notice of Objection is filed, obtaining and preserving proof of submission is crucial.

**Taxpayers should ensure the following:**
