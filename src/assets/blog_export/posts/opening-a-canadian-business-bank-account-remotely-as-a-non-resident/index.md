Opening a business bank account in Canada as a non-resident has become an obtainable goal due to advancements in digital banking services. Non-residents intending to establish or expand their businesses within Canada's borders now have a pathway to manage their finances efficiently despite not being physically present in the country. This facility is largely enabled through certain online banking platforms that have streamlined the remote setup process.

The opening of such an account is subject to specific requirements and the selection of the right financial institution. Non-residents can initiate the process through various online platforms such as [Wise](http://wise.com) and [Airwallex](http://airwallex.com), which are designed to accommodate the banking needs of international clients. Traditional Canadian banks have also started to adapt by offering partial online application processes that can be finalized upon arrival in Canada.
## Non-Resident Business Bank Account Options in Canada


### Virtual Bank Options


Non-residents aiming to open a Canadian business bank account can take advantage of virtual banking services that allow for account opening without the need to be physically present in Canada. Two notable online platforms in this space are Wise and Airwallex, both of which facilitate the process remotely.

[**Wise**](https://wise.com/) offers an international business account that supports multiple currencies. Non-residents find this particularly useful as it simplifies transactions involving different currencies, a common scenario in international business operations. The platform also provides a debit card that can be used globally, making Wise a practical option for those conducting business in various countries.

[**Airwallex**](http://Airwallex.com) is another platform that has reformed the traditional bank account setup process, offering an online-centric approach.

These virtual banks represent a shift in business banking, providing accessible options to global entrepreneurs. By offering online account creation, they eliminate the geographic limitations typically associated with traditional banking.

**[Vault](https://www.tryvault.com/)**states on its website that with an existing Canadian corporation, one can apply for an account with them. This means that non-resident shareholders should be able to first open a Canadian corporation and then apply for a business account through [Vault](https://www.tryvault.com/).

**Established Banks with Online Provisions:** Traditional Canadian banks offer online processes to start the account opening procedure. However, some may require a final in-person verification. Top options include:
1. **RBC** (Royal Bank of Canada)
2. **TD** (Toronto-Dominion Bank)
3. **BMO** (Bank of Montreal)
4. **CIBC** (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce)


Each bank has its own set of requirements for non-residents, which may include:
* Proof of business registration
* Identification documents (e.g., passport)
* Business information and shareholder details


**Account Features:** Online business accounts provided by Canadian banks often come with similar features as traditional ones, such as:
* Online banking access
* Electronic fund transfers
* Cheque services
* Customer support


It is critical for non-residents to verify the eligibility criteria, account features, and fees before proceeding with account opening. They should contact the bank directly to obtain detailed and current information for their specific situation.
### Find a Canadian Bank That Has a Branch in Your Country


Opening a business bank account as a non-resident can be streamlined by choosing a bank with branches in both Canada and your home country. This strategy allows non-residents to benefit from the international presence of these banks, simplifying the process. Below are steps and considerations for non-residents:
1. **Identify Banks with International Branches**: Look for Canadian banks that are operational in your country of residence. Banks with a global network often offer services to international clients, easing the account setup process.
2. **Check Eligibility Requirements**: Each bank may have its criteria for opening business accounts for non-residents. Review these requirements on the bank's official website or by contacting their international client services.
3. **Understand the Services Offered**: Establish what banking services are provided through the international branches. Ensure they match your business needs, such as wire transfers, business loans, and credit facilities.
4. **Initiate the Process**: Upon selecting a bank, reach out to the local branch in your country to start the account opening process. They can guide you through their remote procedures and required documentation.
5. **Prepare Necessary Documentation**: Typically, you'll need to provide business documentation, identity proof, and possibly evidence of business activities in Canada.
6. **Complete the Setup**: Follow the bank's process for verification and account creation. This may include digital meetings and submission of documents electronically.


Setting up a business bank account in this manner may offer advantages such as:
* **Ease of Access**: Using a bank with local representation can provide more accessible customer service.
* **Integration of Services**: International banks can offer integrated services across different countries, aiding in seamless transactions.


However, non-residents should be aware that international branches might have specific limitations and could require businesses to meet certain operational scales.

By carefully considering these factors, non-resident business owners can effectively establish a banking relationship that supports their Canadian enterprise from their country of residence.
### Start the Process Remotely with a Traditional Bank and Visit Canada to Finish It


Opening a business bank account in Canada remotely is possible through traditional banks that cater to non-residents. To begin the process, prospective account holders should initiate contact with a bank that offers services to non-residents and has the capacity to start the opening process online or through correspondence.

**Initial Steps to Take:**
* **Identify the Bank:** Choose a traditional bank with options for non-residents (e.g., RBC, TD, BMO, or CIBC).
* **Gather Documentation:** Prepare necessary documents including a passport, proof of address, and possibly a bank reference.


**Remote Application Process:**
* **Begin Online/Contact the Bank:** Apply through the bank's online platform or reach out directly to set up initial arrangements.
* **Provisional Approval:** Gain conditional approval which may involve limited account capabilities until final verification.


**Finalizing the Account in Canada:**

Upon preliminary account setup, a visit to Canada to meet with a bank representative is required to complete the process. This step is fundamental to:
* **Verify Identity:** Provide face-to-face confirmation of the account holder's identity with original documents.
* **Expand Services:** Access a full range of banking services, including credit solutions.
* **Finalize Account Features:** Set up any additional services and understand the operational aspects of the account.


By following this method, business owners can enjoy the reliability and full services of traditional Canadian banking, complementing the efficiency of initiating the process remotely.
