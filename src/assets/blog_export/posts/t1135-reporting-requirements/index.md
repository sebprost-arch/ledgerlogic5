Canadian taxpayers with international interests must navigate Form T1135, also known as the Foreign Income Verification Statement. This form is crucial for individuals, corporations, certain trusts, and partnerships within Canada who hold specified foreign property with a total cost of over $100,000 at any point during the tax year. The form serves to disclose foreign assets and income, ensuring that taxpayers meet their reporting obligations under Canadian tax law.

The reporting requirements aim to promote transparency in tax matters involving foreign investments, and non-compliance can lead to significant penalties. Form T1135 must be filed alongside the income tax return by the prescribed deadline, which is the same as the due date for submitting the income tax return or partnership information return. It includes detailed information about each specified foreign property, such as the location, cost, and income earned from the property.

Failure to file or incorrect filing of the T1135 can lead to severe repercussions, including penalties. Therefore, understanding the T1135 reporting requirements is essential for taxpayers who are involved in foreign investment and wish to remain compliant with the Canada Revenue Agency.
## Overview of T1135 Foreign Income Verification Statement


The T1135 form is a crucial disclosure for Canadian taxpayers holding foreign property with a total cost of more than $100,000 CAD. Ensuring compliance with this requirement helps maintain transparency with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
### Purpose of T1135


The **Form T1135**, also known as the **Foreign Income Verification Statement**, serves a vital purpose: to report specified foreign property owned by Canadian residents during a tax year. This reporting is mandatory if the total cost of the foreign property exceeds $100,000 CAD at any point within the year. This form helps the CRA track foreign income that should be reported and taxed in Canada, deterring income concealment and promoting an equitable tax system.
### Legal Background


Legally, the requirement to file a Form T1135 is outlined in the Income Tax Act. Taxpayers who meet the criteria must submit this form concurrently with their income tax return or, for partnerships, with their partnership information return. Failure to file or incomplete filings can result in significant penalties. Over the years, diligent adherence to these regulations has been emphasized to uphold the integrity of the tax system and ensure fair taxation on global income.
## Eligibility Criteria


In meeting the T1135 reporting requirements, taxpayers must understand which properties are reportable and who is obligated to file.
### Definition of Specified Foreign Property


**Specified Foreign Property** refers to certain types of property held outside Canada. They include funds in foreign bank accounts, shares in foreign companies, interests in foreign trusts, foreign real estate, and other income-earning foreign properties. The key criterion for reporting is whether the **total cost** of such property **exceeds $100,000 CAD** at any time during the tax year.
### Resident Status and Reporting Obligations


Individuals who are **Canadian residents**, **certain trusts**, and **corporations** have an obligation to file a T1135 form if they own specified foreign property above the mentioned threshold. This includes non-resident trusts that are deemed resident under specific **Foreign Accrual Property Income (FAPI)** rules. The T1135 must be filed by the due date of the taxpayer’s income tax return, even if no income tax is due.
## Filing Requirements


Canadian taxpayers have specific obligations under tax law regarding foreign property. It is crucial they are aware of and comply with Form T1135 filing requirements to accurately report foreign investments.
### Filing Deadlines


The [deadline](https://ledgerlogic.ca/2023/11/03/tax-filing-deadlines-in-canada-a-comprehensive-guide/) for filing Form T1135 aligns with the taxpayer's income tax return due date. **Individuals** must file by April 30th following the calendar year of reporting, while **self-employed individuals** have until June 15th. For **corporations**, the form must be filed no later than six months after the end of the corporation's tax year. **Partnerships** must submit Form T1135 by the due date of the partnership's information return.
### Amended Returns and Voluntary Disclosures


If a taxpayer discovers errors or omissions after submitting Form T1135, they should file an amended return as soon as possible. This action demonstrates compliance and can mitigate potential penalties. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) offers a [**Voluntary Disclosures Program**](https://ledgerlogic.ca/2023/12/21/cra-voluntary-disclosure/) (VDP) for taxpayers who wish to correct incorrect or incomplete information without penalty or prosecution, provided they meet certain criteria and act before they are audited or investigated by the CRA.

## Penalties and Consequences

Taxpayers who do not file the T1135 form by the deadline are subject to a penalty of **$25 per day**. This penalty has a minimum of $100 and can accumulate up to a maximum of $2,500. However, should the non-compliance exceed 24 months, more severe penalties can be imposed.
* For over 24-month infractions, an additional penalty of **5% of the property's cost**, could be levied, potentially increasing the financial consequences significantly.


### Inaccuracies and Omissions

* The penalty for making a false statement or omission is the greater of **$100** or **50% of the understated tax** and/or the overclaimed credits related to the omitted foreign income.
* Continuous non-compliance or negligence is treated severely, with penalties potentially increasing for repeat offenses or gross negligence.


## Supporting Documentation
