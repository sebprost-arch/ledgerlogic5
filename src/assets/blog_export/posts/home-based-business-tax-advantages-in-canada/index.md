## Determining Eligibility for Home-Based Business Deductions


Canadian home-based business owners may be eligible for tax deductions that can lower their taxable income. Understanding the specific criteria and tests is essential to determine qualification for these deductions.
### Criteria for Home Office Deduction

1. **The workspace is where you mainly do your work.**
2. **You use the space only to earn your business income, and you use it on a regular and ongoing basis to meet clients, customers, or patients.**


Documentation such as utility bills, receipts, and records of home improvements should be maintained to support the claim.
### Business Use of Home Exclusivity Test


The business use of home exclusivity test requires that the space used for business must be **exclusively** for that purpose. It cannot be a shared space used intermittently for non-business activities. For instance:
* If an office is also used as a guest room, it does not qualify.
* A dedicated desk area set aside in an open-concept living space may qualify if it is clear that the area is used solely for business purposes.


Evidence of the exclusive use, like photos or floor plans, should be provided when filing taxes.
### Understanding the Principal Place of Business Rule


A home-based business must also pass the *principal place of business* test to qualify for deductions. The space should be:
* **The main place where business is conducted**, or
* **Used exclusively for the business** to earn income and regularly used to meet clients, customers, or patients.


If the business is conducted at multiple locations, the home office should be the focal point of business activities to qualify under this rule.
