## GST/HST Compliance: Both Handle It Well

As a CPA, this is non-negotiable: **both Xero and QuickBooks handle Canadian sales tax properly.**

### What They Both Do Right:
- Automated GST/HST calculation based on your province
- Support for multiple provincial rates (HST in Ontario, PST+GST in BC, etc.)
- Easy filing from within the platform
- Tax-inclusive and tax-exclusive pricing options

### Slight Edge to Xero:
- More intuitive tax code setup if you're selling to multiple provinces
- Easier to track GST on international sales (common for exporters)

**Verdict:** Both are compliant. Xero is slightly better for complex tax scenarios, but QuickBooks is perfectly fine for most Canadian businesses.

## Ease of Use: Xero Wins on Design

I'm biased here because I find Xero cleaner, but let me be objective.

### Xero Interface:
- **Cleaner dashboard:** You see what matters (bank balance, invoices due, bills to pay)
- **Easier navigation:** Everything is where you expect it
- **Learning curve:** 2–3 hours to feel comfortable

### QuickBooks Interface:
- **More features visible:** Can feel cluttered initially
- **More customization:** Power users love this
- **Learning curve:** 4–6 hours to master

**Verdict:** If you want "plug and play," choose Xero. If you want granular control and don't mind a steeper learning curve, QuickBooks may suit you better.

## Payroll: QuickBooks Wins (Hands Down)

This is where QuickBooks pulls ahead significantly.

### QuickBooks Payroll:
- **Built into Plus and Advanced plans**
- Automatic CRA remittances (CPP, EI, income tax)
- T4 generation at year-end
- Direct deposit included
- Provincial payroll tax compliance (Quebec, Ontario, etc.)

### Xero Payroll:
- **Not included** in base plans
- Requires third-party integration (Wave Payroll, Rise, or Wagepoint)
- Additional cost: ~$5–$15/month per employee
- More setup friction

**Verdict:** If payroll is a priority, **QuickBooks wins.** No contest.

---

## Integrations: Xero Wins on App Ecosystem

Xero has a more robust third-party app marketplace, especially for e-commerce and modern SaaS tools.

### Xero Integrations:
- **1,000+ apps** in the Xero App Marketplace
- Seamless connections with Shopify, WooCommerce, Amazon, Stripe
- Popular add-ons: Dext (receipt capture), Fathom (reporting), A2X (e-commerce accounting)

- Strong connections with traditional tools (Square, PayPal, Bill.com)
- Fewer modern e-commerce integrations

**Verdict:** Xero wins if you're running an e-commerce business or using cutting-edge SaaS tools.

QuickBooks offers more powerful out-of-the-box reporting, especially in Advanced plans.

### QuickBooks Reporting:
- **Customizable reports** (filter by class, location, customer)
- Profit & Loss by class/department
- Strong inventory reports
- Better job costing

### Xero Reporting:
- Good standard reports (P&L, balance sheet, aged receivables)
- Reporting is simpler but less customizable
- Requires third-party apps (Fathom, Spotlight) for advanced analytics

**Verdict:** QuickBooks wins if you need detailed management reports or run a multi-location business.
